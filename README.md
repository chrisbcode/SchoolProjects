Here are brief descriptions of each program:

The PythonPowerList program prints an array that represents a user determined base and and amount of subsequent powers.

The PythonDragonGame program takes user input to decide a target number, and runs a while loop to roll dice until all the die's total is at or greater than the target number. If it is at the target number, the user wins the game, if not the user loses the game.

The PythonCoinFlipsInARow program displays information about coin flips and how many flips in a row were a certain face based on how many flips the user wants.
